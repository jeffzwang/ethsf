## Polygon prize info

Our 2 addresses on Mumbai:

ExampleVerifier - `0xD1BfD5d41b50Ff0d072a5552665F08f32a2cCf37`

StayPlatform - `0x2dAbd9E895Eb65d767b70cadD1ead548F63377b6`;

We are going for the Polygon ID prize as well as the best UX prize. We believe
we deserve the Polygon ID prize because of our creative use of ZK proofs to
auto-authenticate a p2p payment. We believe we deserve the UX prize because we
made many considerations in choosing Polygon for our chain and tried to make the
most of it in our UI.
